# Style Guide
Source code is for humans by humans. We need to be able to read and edit each other's programs, and style conventions are a major part of facilitating that exchange. Each language has its own conventions, and TEP's official version is below.

## JavaScript
For the most part, TEP will be following [Google's JS guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html). The only additional requirement is that we will be using 4 spaces per indent.

## Python
Python [docstrings](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) are REQUIRED. When in doubt, look for other PEPs.

## C/C++
TBD
