1. *Find a why.* You need to know why you’re learning how to code before you even touch the keys to write your first program. A project is a good motivator to get started, but a long-term goal will help to keep you on track as you inevitably run into the wall of errors.
2. *Find a how.* This part often entails picking a development environment and language. If your “why” is web development (like NS) then HTML/CSS/JS is standard. The HTML helps you understand the basic structure of the webpage — and the XML tree that the the API will return. CSS is not  100% necessary for a NS API app, but understanding how the web is styled is great if you want to present your information to someone who else. JS is what makes most sites interactive. Did you click a button to get to this site and read this message? Chances are JS triggered the event. If this sounds overwhelming, just choose one of the three, and stick with it for a little bit. JS would probably be the most direct route to the NS API with the help of Auralia’s wrapper. Other languages like C, C++, Java, Go, Perl, and Rust are great for other “why”s, and Python is a nice high-level substitute for JS with the same level of NS support.
3. *Find a who.* Who the program’s audience is a major factor its final form. Personal use can be filled with idiosyncratic shorthand that more general use cannot.
4. *Say hello world.* A simple little program goes a long way. 
5. *Write a little, test a little; debug and comment a lot.* As previously mentioned, you’re going to encounter a loooooot of errors along your programming journey. Forgotten semicolons, mismatched parentheses,  variable names that you could have sworn weren’t capitalized but actually are — well, all of them are normal. Debugging and commenting often will help you stay sane.
6. *Just keep coding.*
