# hello_world
An intro for TEPers to become familiar with Git and GitHub

## Welcome to The East Pacific!
You may have noticed that it doesn't seem like there are that many files in here at the moment. That's because hello_world is the only public repo. You MUST be a citizen ([you can apply here](https://tep.li/citizenship)). Then, you MUST verify your GitHub with the Minister of Virtual Enhancement (MoVE) by telegram to [Evrigenis](https://www.nationstates.net/nation=evrigenis) or Discord DM to y0#5738 before you gain access to the rest of the repositories.

## Welcome to Git
If you're new to programming, welcome to Git! The [GitBook](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is the offical guide to this version control system. You SHOULD read Chapters 1 and 2 if you haven't used Git before.

## Welcome to GitHub
If you're new to programming, welcome to GitHub! It is highly RECOMMENDED to read [the GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github)
