# hello_world
An intro for TEPers to become familiar with Git and GitHub

## Welcome to The East Pacific!
You may have noticed that it doesn't seem like there are that many files in here at the moment. That's because hello_world is the only public repository (repo) in The East Pacific (TEP)'s GitHub organization (GH org). You MUST verify your GitHub account with the Ministry of Virtual Enhancement (MoVE) before you gain access to the rest of the repos. Verification can be completed by the following methods:
* NationStates telegram to [Evrigenis](https://www.nationstates.net/nation=evrigenis#composebutton)
* [Discord](https://discord.com/) DM to y0#5738 
* [TEP Forum PM to borromeanWhyKnot](https://forum.theeastpacific.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=4081)

If you are a citizen ([you can apply here](https://tep.li/citizenship)) you MAY verify account in multiple ways, but only one way is REQUIRED. If you are not a citizen, you MUST verify yourself in multiple ways.

## Welcome to Git
If you're new to programming, welcome to Git! The [GitBook](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is the official guide to this version control system. You SHOULD read [Chapter 1: Getting Started](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control) and [Chapter 2: Git Basics](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics) if you haven't used Git before.

## Welcome to GitHub
If you're new to this site, welcome to GitHub! It is highly RECOMMENDED to read [the GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github). The GitBook's [Chapter 6: GitHub](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Account-Setup-and-Configuration) MAY also be helpful.

## Disclaimer
MoVE's department of Information Technology (IT) is the TEP organization in charge of creating the content for this GH org, but all copyright belongs to [The East Pacific Community Corporation (TEPCC)](https://nonprofit.tep.li/home). Contributing content to this GH org is equivalent to donating intellectual property to TEPCC, which then makes it available to you under [a custom license](https://www.github.com/The-East-Pacific/hello_world/blob/master/LICENSE.md). The License is most similar to the [Creative Commons BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/). In non legalese, you are allowed to adapt, remix, transform, and build upon the material for any purpose — even commercially — under the following terms:
1. Attribution. You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made. You may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses you or your use. 
2. Sharing restrictions may apply. If a file or a repo's README states its contents are "citizens only" or some equivalent form thereof, you MUST NOT distribute Software from it to individuals who are not citizens of The East Pacific. Only MoVE IT staffers or the author may change the "citizens only" status of a file or a repo. If the interests of these two parties conflict, TEPCC's interests serve as the final word. Enforcement of the restrictions of this provision are limited to actions taken by MoVE IT (e.g. denial of further access to private repos) or The East Pacific's Conclave (e.g. an in-game court ruling to revoke your citizenship).
3. As the license is a share-alike, these conditions also apply to all copies and derived works.
4. No warranties are given. The license may not give you all of the permissions necessary for your intended use. For example, other rights such as publicity, privacy, or moral rights may limit how you use the material.
5. Limitation of Liability. TEPCC is not liable for your use nor modification of software.

This is a human readable summary of (and not a substitute for) the license.

Everyone MAY copy and distribute verbatim copies of this README, but no one except MoVE IT staffers may modify it or distribute modified copies.

Within this file, "or" is defined inclusively and requirement levels are indicated in accordance with [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).
